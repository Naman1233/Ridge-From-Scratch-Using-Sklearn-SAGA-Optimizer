Scratch Ridge Regressor Using Sklearn's SAGA Optimizer

This is the model of well known regressor called ridge. Which includes regularization methods(l2). Using sklearn's optimizer you can get best results, and in this method I've simplified the code further so that it is well understandable for ML beginners. 
Use: If you want to inherite the model into a different system, you can easily refer this code and make optimization further.
For example if you have faster validation techniques then you can remove all the validation steps in this code and use it only for getting trained weights using SGD.
Same condition for preprocessing and normalization.
This code is for study purpose. Anyone can refer this as base model.
